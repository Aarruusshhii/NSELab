# Network Security Lab (COM 511), B.Tech Cyber Security â€“ MIET Jammu  

Welcome to the repository for the **Network Security Lab (COM 511)** course, offered to **B.Tech Cyber Security students at the Model Institute of Engineering and Technology (MIET), Jammu**.  

This repository contains the code, configurations, and demonstrations for experiments covered in the lab manual. The material is intended to give students practical exposure to cryptographic algorithms, authentication, secure communication protocols, intrusion detection, and network security tools.  


## Table of Contents  

Each experiment is organized in its own folder (`E1`, `E2`, â€¦ `E10`) for easy navigation.  

1. **E1 â€“ Implement and Analyze Classical Symmetric Ciphers** (Caesar and VigenÃ¨re)  
2. **E2 â€“ Generate SHA-256 Hash and Verify Data Integrity**  
3. **E3 â€“ Simulate User Authentication and Replay Attack Handling** (Challengeâ€“Response Protocol)  
4. **E4 â€“ Generate and Verify X.509 Self-Signed Certificate** (OpenSSL)  
5. **E5 â€“ Capture and Analyze TLS Handshake using Wireshark**  
6. **E6 â€“ Establish Secure Remote Login using SSH**  
7. **E7 â€“ Analyze WPA2 Wireless Security and Capture Handshake**  
8. **E8 â€“ Sending and Receiving PGP Encrypted Email** (Thunderbird)  
9. **E9 â€“ Configure and Analyze IPsec VPN in Tunnel Mode**  
10. **E10 â€“ Setup and Test a Simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Snort**  


## Usage  

- Each experiment is placed in its respective folder (e.g., `E1`, `E2`, â€¦).  
- Open the folder to find source code, scripts, or instructions.  
- Python-based experiments (`E1`, `E2`, `E3`) can be executed using any IDE or Jupyter Notebook.  
- Wireshark, OpenSSL, SSH, Thunderbird, StrongSwan, and Snort are required for respective experiments.
