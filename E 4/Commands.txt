1.	Install OpenSSL if not already installed:
	Linux: usually pre-installed or use sudo apt-get install openssl
	Windows: download from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

2.	Generate private key:
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

3.	Generate a self-signed certificate using the private key:
openssl req -new -x509 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 365
	You will be prompted to enter details like Country, Organization, Common Name (CN), etc.

4.	View the certificate details:
openssl x509 -in certificate.crt -text -noout
	Verify the certificate structure:
	Subject, Issuer (same for self-signed)
	Validity period
	Public key details
	Signature algorithm

	Optional: Verify certificate signature:
openssl verify -CAfile certificate.crt certificate.crt
